# BMP8086
Simple bmp file reader for DOS computers with intel 8086 or compatible cpu and 256 color vga graphics card.

The image will be displayed reflected horizontally, so i recommend flipping it.
Images made in paint will work, in gimp you have to make an 8 bit indexed color image with "Do not write color space information" checked.
If the image is shattered, you should try to change resolution to even numbers. 

To compile the executable, run assemble.bat on machine with DOS (or in DOS emulator like dosbox) and installed Turbo Assembler (TASM)
